#PSY 441 Capstone Project:  Emotion and Recall

###Dominic B.I.A. Tzimisces & Michaela Montalvo

##Introduction

This repository contains most of the data (sans large files), materials, analyses,
and presentation media for the Emotion and Recall quasi-experiment, conducted over the
course of PSY 440 Methods and Labs in Experimental Psychology and PSY 441 Projects in
Experimental Psychology during the Winter and Spring terms of 2015.

The data were culled from our [Emotion and Recall YouTube Experiment]
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iphxvoAOpE4). It was subsequently
processed and analyzed in R Studio and the results were presented to the faculty of
Eastern Oregon University in partial fulfillment for the requirements of a baccalaureate
in psychology.
