#Data analyses and figure creation for the Emotion and Recall YouTube Experiment

###Dominic B.I.A. Tzimisces

##INTRODUCTION

This analysis was created to explain the data analysis behind the [Emotion and Recall YouTube Experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iphxvoAOpE4).  All the materials--the videos, informed consent, etc.--can be found at the above link.  NOTE BENE:  the link--and the videos--do not work properly on Apple products that do not contain Flash support, nor do they work in many smartphones (which, likewise, often do not have Flash support).  Following the links is best done on a PC.
